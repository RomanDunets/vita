	<p>Over three decades, there are certification system management of natural resources, which are used in many industries, particularly the cultivation of environmentally friendly agricultural products, production of quality food and more.</p>
	<p>In fact, forest certification owes its origin to the ecological environmental organizations: in the mid 80s of last century, concerned about destruction of tropical forests, they have resorted to boycott the sale of products made from such wood.</p>
	<p>A large number of forest companies, including giants such as Weyerhauser, McMillanBloedel, Loisiana Pacific and others were subject to withering criticism of environmental organizations as a result struggled to maintain environmentally sensitive markets of Europe. Finding ways to increase confidence in the policies and practices of forest management has led to the formulation of the basic ideas of forest certification in the early 90's as the conformity assessment procedures of forestry to a predetermined environmental, social and economic requirements (standards).</p>
	<p>Proof of compliance (standards) is usually by an independent auditor. The certificate indicates that the products come from forests, forest management which is carried out on the basis of sustainable, permanent and continuous forest management at the forest management takes into account issues of environmental protection and conservation of biological diversity, forest interests of workers and the local population.</p>
	<p>Over time, this process has spread to woodworking, derived from the boreal forests and temperate zones and on the system of forest management in Europe.</p>
